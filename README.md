# Twitter-Mining
## A simple Twitter mining project

This project has 3 main components:
* Access the Twitter API and search for trends from the past 7 days using Twitter's standard search API
* Pick a trend at random and look at frequency distributions of words contained in tweet statuses
* Visualize the frequency distribution using a WordCloud

To use this project you will need to sign up for a Twitter developer account which can be found [here](https://apps.twitter.com/).
Do not share consumer keys/tokens or access keys/tokens.

This project uses the standard search API provided by Twitter which has limitations for free usage:
* Supports 7 days of history
* Limits the number of queries per given time unit
* Limits search operators

More information is available in the developer documentation which can be found [here](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/tweets/search/overview)
